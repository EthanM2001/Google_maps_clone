# I have created a google maps clone using mapbox

I have seen a few people on youtube, reddit and freecodecamp use this library, so I decided to look into it and have a go of it myself.

For those who don't know already, mapbox is a plugin for leaflet, it is a **JavaScript** library in which allows the user to create an interactive map. On top of building a map, you can then add:

- zoom levels
- compasses
- starting and ending destinations
- get directions to get from A to B.

  There are some more advanced features in which you can look through here: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.3.1/

After watching a youtube tutorial on this, I decided I was going to make a simple google maps clone in order to put on my portfolio. Why you may ask...? Although it's simple, I love to learn and experiment with new libraries. This being one of many more to come in the future hopefully. It also helps my confidence as a developer as I know I am now able to use this library comfortably in the future. Using a map may be quite useful for projects such as electric car chargers for example. I wouldn't want to say anymore in case my ideas get stolen now... ðŸ¤”
